# clock

[creativecreatorormaybenot](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot)'s entry to the [Flutter clock challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock).

## TODO

 * Add gitignore that ignores directories based on the publishing requirements of the challenge.

 * Take picture of the real-world inspiration (GDR one).

 * Implement first compositing using `MultiChildRenderObjectWidget`.

 * Get fully familiar with the mock data and design hierarchy to work with the clock data.
