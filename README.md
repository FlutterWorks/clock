# clock

[creativecreatorormaybenot](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot)'s entry to the [Flutter clock challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock).  
I was inspired by the design of an old analog barometer and hygrometer kind of device.

## TODO

 * Implement minute hand and make minute and second hand both bounce.

 * Get fully familiar with the mock data and design hierarchy to work with the clock data.

 * Finish clock first.

 * Implement accessibility.

 * Make clock available on web via GitHub pages.

 * Check [**7.** "JUDGING"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit?usp=sharing).

 * Format code and follow all other steps decribed [here](https://flutter.dev/clock#submissions).
